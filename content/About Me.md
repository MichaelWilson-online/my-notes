My name is Michael.  I started in tech as a computer programmer in the Air Force in 1981.  I answered God's call to become a pastor in 2005 and retired in 2023. I love playing around with computers, phones, table and watches.  I truly enjoy the products that Apple makes. 

I have a Technology site called [The Tech Pastor](https://techpastorsolutions.com) where I help people with their tech.

 I am an avid reader of theology and church history, tech blogs and such.  I seek to learn and grow and to be a better servant of Christ every day, while using my tech to be more productive and efficient.  
 
I perceive technology as a lens of faith, offering a unique perspective that intertwines spiritual beliefs with the advancements of the modern world. Through this lens, every innovation and digital breakthrough becomes more than just a tool or a means to an end; it transforms into a reflection of divine intricacy and a testament to human ingenuity inspired by faith. This viewpoint encourages a harmonious balance between embracing the wonders of technology and maintaining a deep-rooted connection to spiritual values, allowing for a profound appreciation of how technological progress can complement and enhance spiritual journeys and understandings.
 
 Through this blog I hope to connect with people who share similar interests and passions.
