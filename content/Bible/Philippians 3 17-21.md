Philippians 3:17-21 is a powerful passage in the Bible that offers a message of hope, encouragement, and guidance for believers. In this passage, the Apostle Paul urges his readers to follow his example and warns them of those who live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Let's take a closer look at this scripture and explore its purpose, meaning, and application.

## Purpose 
The purpose of Philippians 3:17-21 is to encourage believers to live in a manner that reflects their identity as citizens of heaven. Paul reminds the Philippians that they are not citizens of this world but rather of heaven, and therefore their focus should be on living in a way that honors God and prepares them for eternity.

## Meaning 
In Philippians 3:17-21, Paul contrasts the lives of those who live as enemies of the cross with the lives of those who follow his example. He describes the enemies of the cross as people who are focused on earthly things, their stomachs, and their own desires. In contrast, he encourages the Philippians to follow his example and to focus on the things that are above, to set their minds on heavenly things, and to live in a way that honors God.

## Application 
As believers, we can apply the teachings of Philippians 3:17-21 to our lives in several ways. Here are some practical ways to apply this passage:

1.  Follow the example of faithful believers - Just as Paul urges the Philippians to follow his example, we too should look to those who have gone before us and have lived a life of faith. We can learn from their example and strive to live in a way that honors God.
    
2.  Set our minds on heavenly things - It's easy to get caught up in the things of this world, but as believers, we are called to set our minds on heavenly things. We should focus on God's kingdom and seek to live in a way that reflects our heavenly citizenship.
    
3.  Avoid living as enemies of the cross - Paul warns the Philippians about those who live as enemies of the cross. We too should be careful not to fall into the trap of living for our own desires and pleasures but instead should strive to live a life that honors God.
    
4.  Keep our ultimate destination in mind - Paul reminds us that our citizenship is in heaven, and we should keep this in mind as we live our lives. We should strive to live in a way that prepares us for eternity and honors God.
    

In conclusion, Philippians 3:17-21 is a powerful passage that offers guidance and encouragement for believers. By following the example of faithful believers, setting our minds on heavenly things, avoiding living as enemies of the cross, and keeping our ultimate destination in mind, we can live a life that honors God and prepares us for eternity.
