Dated April 16, 2023
Dear Church Board Members,

It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you of my decision to retire as the pastor of our church, effective May 31, 2023. After serving our community for 18 years, I have decided that it is time for me to step down and allow new leadership to take the reins.

It has been a great honor and privilege to serve as the pastor of our church for nearly two decades. I will always cherish the memories and relationships that I have built during my time here. I am grateful for the support and encouragement that I have received from each and every one of you, and for the trust that you have placed in me as your spiritual leader.

As I reflect on my time as pastor, I am filled with a sense of awe at the many ways that God has blessed our church. We have weathered difficult times together, celebrated joyful occasions, and supported each other through all of life's ups and downs. I am proud of the work that we have accomplished together, and of the ways that we have grown as a community of faith.

I want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. After much prayerful consideration, I believe that it is time for me to pass the baton to the next generation of leadership. I have every confidence that God will continue to guide and bless our church in the years to come.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to the church board, the staff, and the congregation for your unwavering support and partnership. It has been an honor to serve alongside you all. I will always hold a special place in my heart for our church community, and I will continue to pray for God's blessing on our ministry.

Sincerely,

Rev. Michael L. Wilson
